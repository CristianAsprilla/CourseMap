Environment setup
-----------------

Create a `.env` file in this directory with the following variables (copy from this template):

```
AZURE_ENDPOINT=https://<your-cognitive-services>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
AZURE_API_VERSION=2025-05-01-preview
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=
# AZURE_CONTENT_UNDERSTANDING_AAD_TOKEN=
AZURE_ANALYZER_ID=Extract-Table
FILE_LOCATION=./Data/utp-test-2.pdf
```

Do not commit `.env`. Ensure your repo ignores it, e.g. add this to your `.gitignore`:

```
backend/.env
```

Install dependencies
--------------------

Use your preferred tool (e.g. uv/pip/poetry) to install:

```
requests>=2.32.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.1
```
